## Introduction

This project aims at analyzing Sales data to identify trends, patterns and gain insights by using IF Functions and Pivot Tables. Further, Conditional Formatting is applied on Summary tables for easier analysis.

## Data

The original data used contained 20 variables and 9994 Observations. This data is found in the Data Folder in the repository named as "Superstore-Sales.xlsx" contained on the sales worksheet.
To perform the analysis properly, a new column, named Profit/Loss. Therefore, the final data had 21 Variables and 9994 observations. The final workbook contained worksheets named: State, Ctegory, SubCategory, City, Region, Sales and CoGS, Profit and Sales. The Excel Workbook is named "Superstore.xlsx".

## Analysis Method

### IF Function

This function has been used to classify the profit values as either profit for values greater than 0 or Loss for values less than 0 and stored in the Profit/Loss Variable.

### Pivot Tables

Pivot tables have been used to create summary tables. This can also be filter.

### Conditional Formatting

All tables containing the the Profit Varible, conditional formatting has been applied. That is, all values greater than 0 have been highlighted in Green to present Profit and those less than 0 are highlighted in Red to present Loss.

### Line Chart

Line charts have been applied on Profits, Sales and CoGS over time to identify trends and pattern.
